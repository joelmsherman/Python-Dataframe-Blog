# Basic Dataframe Manipulation in Pandas
The purpose of this project is to work through and share my learnings on basic pandas dataframe manipulations for data scientists.  My aim is to both solidfy my knowledge and teach others about a basic introduction to Python Pandas.

The code is available in this repository as a Jupyter Notebook (Basic_PandasDF_Manipulation).  While I use a personal datasource* I have renamed all dimension columns to dim1, dim2, ... dimn, and all measure columns to meas1, meas2, ... measn.  To use the notebook, simply upload your own data using this schema, or feel free to analyze the data in this repository (data.csv).
