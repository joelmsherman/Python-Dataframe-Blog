# Basic Dataframe Manipulation in Pandas
The purpose of this project is to work through and share my learnings on basic pandas dataframe manipulations for data scientists.  My aim is to both solidfy my knowledge and teach others about a basic introduction to Python Pandas.

The code is available in this repository as a Jupyter Notebook (Basic_PandasDF_Manipulation).  My datasource for this project is HRV_Training_Sleep.csv in this repo.  It is daily data on key training, performance and sleep metrics for my cycling training.
