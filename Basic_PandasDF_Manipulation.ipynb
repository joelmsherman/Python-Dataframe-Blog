    "Pandas is widely regarded as one of Python's most used libraries for data science, and there are a variety of online course, youtube videos and blogs about its use.  This project and blog post is aimed at providing new Python users with some of the basics of manipulating the Pandas dataframe.  I will cover the following areas:\n",
